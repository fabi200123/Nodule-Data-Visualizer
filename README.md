# HelpBreath - Platform to visualize 3D and analyse lung nodules

Helpbreath has 2 main components:
- **MERN app**
- **Python App**

## **MERN App**

In order to run the MERN App, you have to start the backend and the frontend of the application!

### To start the Backend:

- install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
- run the code:
```bash
npm start
```

### To start the Frontend:
**Note:** Run the frontend code, after the backend is started!

- install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
- run the code:
```bash

Those commands run the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
